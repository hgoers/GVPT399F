## Data visualization

We will use data visualization to answer the following question:

> Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

## EXERCISE {background-color="#B56576"}

1.  What do you think is the answer to this question?

<br>

2.  How would you prove your answer? What information about cars would you need?

## R4DS

This session will borrow (read: *steal*) heavily from Hadley Wickham's *R for Data Science* book.

## Data visualization: a critical skill

-   You can learn an incredible amount about your data from plotting it

-   Easier to digest the vast amount of information required to do data analysis from a plot than raw numbers

## Skipping to the end

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Engine displacement and highway miles per gallon",
    subtitle = "Values for seven different classes of cars",
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway miles per gallon"
  )
```

## How did we do this?

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Engine displacement and highway miles per gallon",
    subtitle = "Values for seven different classes of cars",
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway miles per gallon"
  )
```

::: aside
We will step through this now. By the end of this session, you will be able to make your own colourful data visualisations using R.
