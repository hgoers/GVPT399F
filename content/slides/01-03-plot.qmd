## Data visualisation

We will use data visualization to answer the following question:

> Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

## Set up your plot

*An empty canvas!*

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

## Map your aesthetics

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

## Add in your cars

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## EXERCISE {background-color="#B56576"}

1.  Make a scatter plot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

<br>

2.  What happens if you make a scatter plot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

<br>

3.  Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point()
```

## ANSWERS {background-color="#B56576"}

1.  Make a scatter plot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl)) + 
  geom_point()
