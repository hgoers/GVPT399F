## Learning objectives for today

1.  Introduction to R

2.  Introduction to RStudio

## Why R?

-   A versatile programming language

    -   All materials used in this course were produced using R, including the website and fancy slides

-   Free and accessible!

## R and RStudio

## A Tour of RStudio

## R basics

R code:

```{r}
1 + 2
```

Functions:

```{r}
sum(1, 2)
```

## EXERCISE {background-color="#B56576"}

1.  Open up RStudio.
2.  Using the console, find the summation of `45`, `978`, and `121`.
3.  What is `67` divided by `6`?
4.  What is the square root of `894`? HINT: use the `sqrt()` function.

## CHECK YOUR ANSWERS {background-color="#B56576"}

Using the consol, find the summation of `45`, `978`, and `121`.

```{r}
sum(45, 978, 121)
```

*Or:*

```{r}
45 + 978 + 121
```

What is `67` divided by `6`?

```{r}
67 / 6
```

What is the square root of `894`?

```{r}
sqrt(894)
```

## Functions

## R packages

Packages are collections of R functions and data.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Install the relevant package(s)
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load the packages in current session
library(tidyverse)
```

::: aside
`tidyverse` is a collection of many different packages The individual packages are listed when you load the `tidyverse` package.
:::

## EXERCISE {background-color="#B56576"}

1.  Open up RStudio.
2.  Using the console, install the `tidyverse` packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("tidyverse")
```

3.  Load these packages in your current session

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
```

## RStudio Projects

*For your sanity's sake, for your co-author's sanity's sake*

Keeps everything:

-   Organised

-   Reproducible

-   Sustainable

::: aside
For later reference, head to Hadley Wickham's [*Workflow: projects* chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#workflow-projects) in R4DS.
:::

## EXERCISE {background-color="#B56576"}

1.  In the RStudio console, type in `getwd()` to see where you are on your computer.
